# NTK_EFT
MPhys Project


This is a repository with the code for my MPhys project.

We performed three experiments in this project. First we compared empirical NTKs with a field theoretic prediction for various activations. We then looked at how the NTK from ensembles of networks scales with the network width. Finally, we explored how the NTK changes if we change the data set size D. We mostly ran these through codes separately through a Linux terminal. As a result, in this repository we provided the scripts for the experiments, and these can be adjusted according to need.
